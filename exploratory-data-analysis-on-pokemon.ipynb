As such, a column which indicates the generation when the said pokemon was introduced to the series need to be added. Furthermore as I also will be exploring the strength of Pokemon, it will not be fair to compare a common Pokemon with a legendary or mythical Pokemon so I will also need another column to indicate if the said Pokemon is a legendary or not a legendary.\n\nI have also noticed that for Pokemon such as Charmander, who does not have a Type 2 property, a '-' was used.\\\nThough it might not be a problem but it might not be informational to have a '-' in our legends when I start doing visualisations so I might want to replace the '-' with another indicator such as N/A for Pokemons without Type 2 properties. I did explore the thought of matching the Type 2 attribute with the Type 1 attribute for Pokemon that only has single type but if I think about it from the gameplay perspective, it might not make sense due to how weaknesses works.\n\nFor example, a WATER pokemon is weak to lightning so it will take 2x more damage from lightning moves. Similiarly, a FLYING pokemon is also weak to lightning so it will also take 2x more damage from lightning moves. Therefore, if a dual type Pokemon has WATER and FLYING and its Type 1 and Type 2 respectively, such as Gyrados, it will take 4x more damage from lightning moves. So if I were to make Charmander's Type 1 and Type 2 FIRE, technically speaking, Charmander will take 4x more damage from water moves, which is not the case.

Although I know that Pokemon has the current trend of introducing new evolutions or new forms for everyone's iconic Pokemons in Generation 1 but to be topping the chart across the nine generations was indeed a little suprising.\n\nTo really determine the number of new Pokemon introduced in each generations, not account for mega evolutions or region-specific forms, I plotting a second set of graphs that only took accounted for the base form for each Pokemon. This meanings for Pokemon like Charizard, that has its original form along with its two different mega evolutions, only one will be taken into account. This will give me a much more accurate view of the number of new Pokemon being released each generation.\n\nFrom the bar graph generated, it is noticeable that there was a huge drop in new Pokemons introduced after Generation 5, which is Pokemon Black 2 and White 2. This was most likely due to the fact that Generation 6, Pokemon X and Pokemon Y, introduced the new concept of Mega Evolution, which rehashed the design of Pokemons from older generations. This trend of rehashing older Pokemon continued from Generation 6 onwards all the way till Generation 9, which introduced of region-specific forms of older Pokemon such as the Alolan archetype, Galarian archetype, Hisuian archetype and Paldean archetype.\n\nThis makes me wonder if GameFreak has ran out of innovative ideas for new Pokemon designs or some market research has been done by them, which gave them data that favours the option of making new design of the good old classics generations of Pokemon.

I will also not be taking into account mega evolutions and region-specific pokemons because this archetype of pokemon tended to cater towards the older generations as seen in section 4.1, which may skewed the results.\n\nThe comparision of strength will be done by averaging the Base Stats Total (BST) across the nine generations and based on the result shown in the bar graph plotted, Generation 9 has the strongest pokemons while Generation 3 has the weakest.

When solely looking at the lower limits of the BST, there was a huge disparity between Generation 5 and the other generations.

Although the legendaries in Generation 6 has the highest average across the generations, when I look at the distribution of BST, the upper limit of Generation 4 was much higher compared to the rest. This was attributed to none other than the God of Pokemon, Arceus, who has BST of 720. When compared to the top legendaries of the other generations, most of them were in the higher 600s and only Arceus went pass the total of 700. Truly benefit the role of the God of Pokemon.\n\nNow things get interesting when we look at the weaker legendaries. In most generations, the legendaries were only on par with their own counterparts within their own generations but in Generation 7 and 8, there was a huge disparity with the weakest legendary in Generation 7, Cosmog, who has a BST of only 200 and the strongest legendary in Generation 7, Solgaleo, who has a BST of 680!\n\nThis might indicate a slight paradigm shift in the status of legendaries as after doing some research, legendaries in Generation 7 were mostly presented as guardians or symbolic icons to certain part of the story in Generation 7. Their designs also leaned towards the cuter side, which might be the reason why this generation of legendaries were much weaker than the rest as they are not designed for Pokemon battles.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"test_df = df.drop_duplicates(subset='Base Name', keep='first')\ntest_df = test_df.loc[test_df['Legendary'] == True]\n\ngengrpstr_nl_df = test_df.groupby(['Generation'], as_index=False)['BST'].mean()\n\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1,3, figsize=(20, 5))\n\nax1 = sns.barplot(x='Generation', y='BST', data=gengrpstr_nl_df, ax=axs[0])\nfor i in ax1.containers:\n    ax1.bar_label(i, fmt='%.2f')\nax1.title.set_text('Average strength of legendaries across generation')\n\nax2 = sns.boxplot(x='Generation', y='BST', data=test_df, ax=axs[1])\nax2.title.set_text('Strength of legendaries across generation (Box Plot)')\n\nax3 = sns.violinplot(x='Generation', y='BST', data=test_df, ax=axs[2])\nax3.title.set_text('Strength of legendaries across generation (Violin Plot)')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-02T15:57:27.659233Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-02T15:57:27.659834Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-02T15:57:28.76166Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-02T15:57:27.659795Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-02T15:57:28.760599Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"test_df = df.drop_duplicates(subset='Base Name', keep='first')\ntest_df = test_df.loc[test_df['Legendary'] == True]\n\ntop10_df = test_df.loc[test_df.groupby('Generation')['BST'].idxmax()]\ntop10_df","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-02T15:57:28.7632Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-02T15:57:28.763909Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-02T15:57:28.789215Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-02T15:57:28.763877Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-02T15:57:28.788205Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"top10_df.sort_values(['BST'], ascending=False)","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-02T15:57:28.790465Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-02T15:57:28.790769Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-02T15:57:28.809948Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-02T15:57:28.790742Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-02T15:57:28.808822Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"test_df = df.drop_duplicates(subset='Base Name', keep='first')\ntest_df = test_df.loc[test_df['Legendary'] == True]\n\nbtm10_df = test_df.loc[test_df.groupby('Generation')['BST'].idxmin()]\nbtm10_df","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-02T15:57:28.811497Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-02T15:57:28.811983Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-02T15:57:28.837129Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-02T15:57:28.811943Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-02T15:57:28.835961Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"btm10_df.sort_values(['BST'], ascending=True) ","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-02T15:57:28.838673Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-02T15:57:28.839138Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-02T15:57:28.858102Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-02T15:57:28.839097Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-02T15:57:28.856607Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 Which starter to choose?\n\nThe biggest decision I ever had to make when I was a child.
